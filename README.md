# THE SONG 🎵

Welcome to the ultimate experiment in musical chaos.

**THE SONG** is a massively-collaborative MIDI editor where strangers from around the world come together to create... well, something. It might be a symphony. It might be a digital train wreck. But it will be *ours*.

## Why?

- 🎹 **To make noise:** Because the internet isn't loud enough yet.
- 🤝 **To prove a point:** That humans can cooperate (or at least hit the same notes eventually).
- 🤪 **For the chaos:** Stress-testing my patience and my home server in one go.
- 🎩 **The secret reason:** It's technically a job interview assignment, but let's just call it "Art".
